# Team name: Natural Dim Sum Processing

# Team members:

### Binqian Zeng

I'm a second-year M.S candidate in data science. I have a background in mathematics and text analysis. I worked as a data scientist intern in IBM last summer. My team works on automatic metadata generation from unstructured documents. I currently work as a software engineer intern in Crypto Investment, trying to build a recommend system for cryptocurrency arbitrage based on sentiment analysis. I'm interested in natural language processing related projects and want to implement some deep learning method in natural language processing. My most comfortable programming language is Python. 


### Kailing Wang
I am a second-year student of MS in Data Science program. Previously, I earned my bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. With the passion for data science, I have not only been exposed to but also obtained hand-on experience with statistics, machine learning, artificial neural network and natural language processing techniques. This summer, I interned at IT Department at Aflac Global Investments. This Wall Street internship gives me an opportunity to apply machine learning methods to solve real issues in financial industry. Currently, I am an NLP intern at Roivant Sciences. 


### Weitao Lin
I'm a second-year master student from NYU Data Science Master Program with a background in economics. I'm strongly interested in applying data science techniques to real life problems and have worked with 3 professors at NYU as a research assistant. During this summer, I worked as a summer intern at Royal Bank of Canada and built an artificial intelligent tool to optimize resources utilization, which is now running in production. I hope with some knowledge and techniques I learn from courses and other experience, I can do some cool things and bring some changes to the world.  

# Reason for teaming up: 
We all have strong interest in exactly the same top 3 projects we want to do.

# Top 3 projects:
### Smart question-answering system (Princeton University)
### Automatic enrichment of TV series and movies transcripts (CNRS)
### Industrial Representation and Classification via Deep Learning

We choose these 3 projects mainly because solving them involves a lot of NLP, which is very interesting to all of us. The other reason is because they are just cool.
